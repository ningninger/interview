### 归并排序

> MergeSort is used for sorting data efficiently, particularly for large datasets and external sorting where data cannot fit into memory. 
>
> The main idea of MergeSort is based on the Divide and Conquer strategy. It divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorts these sublists, and then merges them back together to form a single sorted list. 
>
> The time complexity of MergeSort is O(n log n). The algorithm involves three main steps: dividing the list into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves into a single sorted list. 
>
> A potential drawback of MergeSort is that it is not an in-place algorithm, requiring additional space for merging, which can be a limitation in memory-constrained environments.

1. divide and conquer
   1. sublists
   2. merge
2. time complexity
3. draw back: not in-place



### 快速排序

> QuickSort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm used primarily for in-memory sorting. It uses the Divide and Conquer strategy, selecting a pivot, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the subarrays. With an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), QuickSort is faster than many other sorting algorithms, but care must be taken to avoid its O(n²) worst-case scenario. It is in-place but not stable.

1. process:
   1. select a pivot
   2. partition
   3. recursively sorting
2. time complexity
   1. average-case 
   2. worst-case
3. advantage: in-place
4. drawback: not stable

### 堆排序

> HeapSort is used for sorting data efficiently, especially in applications requiring priority queues. The main idea of HeapSort is based on the heap data structure. It first builds a max heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until all elements are sorted. The time complexity of HeapSort is O(n log n) for both the average and worst cases. The algorithm involves building a max heap, swapping the first element (maximum) with the last element of the heap, reducing the heap size by one, and heapifying the root to restore the heap property. This process is repeated until the heap is empty. A potential drawback of HeapSort is that it is not stable, meaning it does not preserve the order of equal elements. Additionally, while it has good time complexity, it may not be as fast as QuickSort in practice due to less efficient use of the memory cache.

1. process
   1. build a max heap
   2. swap  the first with the last and reduce the heap size by one
   3. fix the heap
   4. repeat until the heap is empty
2. time complexity
3. advantage: in-place
4. drawback: not stable

## 介绍课程

### 操作系统

> An operating systems course provides a deep understanding of how computer systems manage hardware and software resources. It covers key concepts such as process management, where you learn how the OS schedules tasks, handles concurrency, and manages inter-process communication. Memory management is another critical area, focusing on how the OS allocates and manages memory, including concepts like virtual memory and paging. The course also delves into file systems, teaching you how data is stored, retrieved, and organized on disk. Security and protection mechanisms are explored to understand how the OS safeguards resources and data from unauthorized access. By the end of the course, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how operating systems function, enabling you to design and optimize system software effectively.

### 面向对象

面向对象是一种编程的范式，它的主要想法是将客观世界中的实体抽象为程序中的类，将其设计到的数据和操作封装到这个类中，他的核心概念包括，封装（Encapsulation）、继承（Inheritance）、多态（Polymorphism），这种编程范式由于是对客观世界的映射，所以我们可以更加容易组织和管理其代码、使代码更具可读性、易于扩展和便于维护，进而提高了它的可靠性。



Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm. Its main idea is to abstract entities from the real world into classes in a program, encapsulating the data and operations related to them within these classes. Its core concepts include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. This programming paradigm, being a reflection of the real world, allows us to organize and manage code more easily, making it more readable, extendable, and maintainable. Consequently, it enhances its reliability.





## 面试题

### quicksort

> Quicksort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm. The main idea of it is divide-and-conquer strategy. It will select a pivot and divide the array to subarrays according this pivot and then continue this process to these subarrays. The time complexity of it is O n log n, on average, but it somethings will have a time complexity of O n squared. It is because of its un-average partition. So when we use it, we usually shuffle arrays or select a nice pivot before we use this algorithm. Additionally, it is in place and stable, we should also pay attention to this feature.



### prim

> Prim is a highly efficient algorithm to find a  minimum spanning tree AKA MST of a weighted, connected, undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. It is important for network building.
>
> In particular, Prim‘s algorithm works by selecting the edge with the minimum weight among all the edges that connect the vertices in the MST to the vertices outside the MST,  until forming a MST.
> The time complexity of Prim's algorithm can vary depending on how it is implemented. Prim's algorithm is especially useful in graph where there are many edges.
>
> 



### kruskal

> Kruskal is a highly efficient algorithm to find a  minimum spanning tree AKA MST of a weighted, connected, undirected graph. The MST is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices together without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. It is important for network building.
>
> In particular, Kruskal‘s algorithm works by selecting the minimum weight edge that can't generate a circle in the MST from all edges in the graph until forming a MST.
> The time complexity of Kruskal's algorithm can vary depending on how it is implemented. Kruskal's algorithm is especially useful in graph where there are less edges.



### tcp/ip

> The TCP/IP network structure is the fundamental framework for the Internet and most  local networks. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It consists of four levels. There are Application Layer,  Transport Layer,  Internet Layer,  and Network Link Layer.
>
> Application Layer is the top layer where network applications works , such as Http for web browsing, FTP for file transfer, SMTP for email
>
> Transport Layer provides communication service for the application processes running on different hosts.
>
> Internet Layer provides communication service for hosts.
>
> Link Layer covers how data is physically sent through the network.
>
> The TCP/IP model is highly scalable and robust, making it basis of the modern Internet



### https

> Https stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. The proto It is an extension of HTTP, the protocol used for application Layer in TCP/IP network structure, but with an added layer of security provided by SSL/TLS protocols.
>
> In particular, Https works by providing encryption, authentication, data integrity and so on to ensure more strong security than HTTP.
>
> 



### sql

> "SQL, also known as Structured Query Language, is a powerful language used for managing relational databases."
>
> "In particular, SQL allows us to create new databases and tables within a database management system. Additionally, we can use SQL to update, delete, and create data or records in our databases."
>
> "It also provides permission-setting services to enhance the security of our databases."
>
> "In summary, SQL simplifies database management by abstracting away complexities such as parallelism and data rollback, allowing users to focus on higher-level tasks."

 



### database

> A database is a system that helps store and manage data.It keeps data organized in tables, which are similar to spreadsheets with rows and columns. Each row is a record, and each column is a piece of information about that record, such as a name or age. 
>
> You can use a special language called SQL to ask the database questions and get the information you need. This process is known as querying. Databases also allow you to add new data, update existing data, or delete data you no longer need, ensuring that the information stays current. 
>
> Security measures in databases make sure that only authorized people can access or change the data, protecting sensitive information.
>
>  Additionally, you can regularly back up the database to prevent data loss, and if something goes wrong, you can restore the data from these backups.
