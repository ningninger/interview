### 归并排序

> MergeSort is used for sorting data efficiently, particularly for large datasets and external sorting where data cannot fit into memory. 
>
> The main idea of MergeSort is based on the Divide and Conquer strategy. It divides the unsorted list into smaller sublists, sorts these sublists, and then merges them back together to form a single sorted list. 
>
> The time complexity of MergeSort is O(n log n). The algorithm involves three main steps: dividing the list into two halves, recursively sorting each half, and then merging the two sorted halves into a single sorted list. 
>
> A potential drawback of MergeSort is that it is not an in-place algorithm, requiring additional space for merging, which can be a limitation in memory-constrained environments.





### 快速排序

> QuickSort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm used primarily for in-memory sorting. It uses the Divide and Conquer strategy, selecting a pivot, partitioning the array, and recursively sorting the subarrays. With an average-case time complexity of O(n log n), QuickSort is faster than many other sorting algorithms, but care must be taken to avoid its O(n²) worst-case scenario. It is in-place but not stable.



### 堆排序

> HeapSort is used for sorting data efficiently, especially in applications requiring priority queues. The main idea of HeapSort is based on the heap data structure. It first builds a max heap from the input data, then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until all elements are sorted. The time complexity of HeapSort is O(n log n) for both the average and worst cases. The algorithm involves building a max heap, swapping the first element (maximum) with the last element of the heap, reducing the heap size by one, and heapifying the root to restore the heap property. This process is repeated until the heap is empty. A potential drawback of HeapSort is that it is not stable, meaning it does not preserve the order of equal elements. Additionally, while it has good time complexity, it may not be as fast as QuickSort in practice due to less efficient use of the memory cache.
